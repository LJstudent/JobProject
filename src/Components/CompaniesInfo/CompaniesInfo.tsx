                        Next to our payments offering Adyen is also building an entire suite of embedded financial services for platforms such as marketplaces, SaaS platforms, on-demand platforms or crowdfunding platforms. Our Chicago engineering hub is focusing on that!
                        <br></br><br></br>
                        We give platforms the ability to manage their global payments ecosystem in one place through API integrations or by using our hosted onboarding solution. They can run onboarding, verification and compliance processes for various markets, process payments and trigger faster payouts and bank transfers in all preferred currencies. Additionally they can enable financial services such as issuing, capital and banking.
                        <br></br><br></br>
                        We are looking for a frontend engineer that can help take our merchant onboarding experience through hosted pages to the next level. Additionally you might be involved with building shared frontend components and libraries that will allow us to efficiently operate our suite of embedded financial services.
